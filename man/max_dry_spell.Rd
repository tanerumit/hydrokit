\title{Compute Maximum Dry-Spell Duration}
\usage{
max_dry_spell(P, threshold = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{P}{Numeric vector of daily precipitation values.}

\item{threshold}{Numeric. Precipitation threshold (in mm) used to define a
dry day. Defaults to \code{1} (i.e., days with P < 1 mm are considered dry).}
}
\value{
An integer value representing the length (in days) of the longest continuous
dry spell. Returns \code{0} if no dry days occur in the series.
}
\description{
Calculates the longest continuous sequence of dry days in a precipitation
time series. A dry day is defined as any day with precipitation below a user-
specified threshold. The function uses run-length encoding to identify
consecutive dry runs and returns the maximum duration in days.
}
\examples{
# Example precipitation series
P <- c(0, 0.2, 0.5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 5)

# Longest dry spell with default threshold (1 mm)
max_dry_spell(P)

# Using a stricter threshold
max_dry_spell(P, threshold = 0.1)
